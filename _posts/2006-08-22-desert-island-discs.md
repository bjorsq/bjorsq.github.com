excerpt: Trying to figure out a way to cheat the ten song limit
---

I've thought a lot about Desert Island Discs. Imagined what I would choose - I'm sure everyone who is familiar with the programme has. I wonder if everyone gets lost after about the top five like I always seem to do. Maybe some people actually manage to choose ten and place them in order, even decide what witty remarks and reminiscences they will pepper their selections with. I always seem to get stuck.

The main reason I only get five at the most is that I wonder how I'm going to cope with only ten. I had a theory that if I could choose really long pieces of music, at least I would have lots of music to take. If I could find some pieces of music which lasted a few hours, or even a day (or two), then my ten records would last quite a long time. I could dip into them and pretend I was listening to lots of different bits of music. I could have a marathon where I listen to all the music end to end - may take a few days. I could have a special time of day when I would stop foraging for food for a few hours to listen to a single record.

Another thing I thought was if you get one choice, then are they going to give you a compilation of the music you choose, or will you get the full CD/LP which the piece is taken from - so I get to thinking about choosing pieces of music which only appear on huge box sets, or insisting that you have the version from the boxed edition or something, just to increase the volume and choice available.

Then I think about how you would play the music anyway - is there some kind of sound system or a crappy wind-up phonograph? That would probably influence my choice of music a little... then I think about the luxury item and try to cheat by making it the worlds biggest mp3 player with the entire recording history of mankind on it... then I get fed up with the whole thing and give up.
