ingredients
-----------

### canneloni

* 250g cannelloni dried pasta tubes
* 1kg frozen spinach
* 200g packet feta cheese
* 200g cream cheese
* 1 egg, beaten
* handful of fresh mint

### sauce

* Olive oil
* 2 onions
* 4 cloves garlic
* 2 tins plum tomatoes
* 1 tbsp tomato pur√©e
* &frac12; tsp. basil
* &frac12; tsp. oregano
* 1 bay leaf
* Handful of grated mozzarella

method
------

1. Boil the spinach for 5 minutes, then drain and squeeze as much liquid out as you can.
2. Chop the spinach and mint, and add to a bowl with the cheeses and egg. Add freshly ground black pepper to taste. Mix it all up with your hands!
3. Stuff the cannelloni carfully with the sloppy spinachy mixture - you will probably have a few spare tubes from the box in case you smash some. Line the cannelloni up in a casserole dish - they should fill the dish up with a few millimetres between each tube - try not to stack them too tightly or let them touch each other.
4. Fry the onions in olive oil with the garlic for 5 - 10 mins, then add the tomatoes and herbs and simmer for 15 - 20 mins.
5. Remove the bay leaf, add the tomato puree and liquidise the sauce. Season with salt and pepper. The sauce should be quite loose - when the cannelloni cook they will absorb water from the sauce so it shouldn't be too thick.
6. Cover the cannelloni evenly with the sauce so all the pasta is covered, then sprinkle over the mozzarella.
7. Cover the dish in foil and bake in a preheated oven at 180&#8451; (355&#8451;) for 45 minutes. Take off the foil for the last 10 minutes to crisp up the cheese a bit.
