method

1. Combine the flour, sugar, salt and butter for the pastry and rub in the butter (or use a food processor) to get crumbs. Bind the pastry with the cold water and chill for 30 mins.
2. Grease a 25cm tart case and pre-heat the oven to 200&deg;C / 400&deg;F / gas mark 6
3. Roll out the pastry and line the tart case - bake in the oven with baking beans for 15 minutes, then remove the beans and bake for another 5 minutes until golden. Turn the oven down to 180&deg;C / 350&deg;F / gas mark 4.
4. While the pastry is cooking, make the frangipane - cream together the butter and sugar and beat in the eggs.
5. Add the flour, ground almonds, baking powder and lemon zest, and fold into the mixture.
6. Pour the frangipane into the cooked pastry shell.
7. Quarter the apricots (apart from one which you save a half apricot for the centre), and arrange them on top of the frangipane.
8. Sprinkle with a teaspopn of sugar, and bake in the oven for 30 minutes until golden, scattering over the flaked almonds five minutes before the end.
9. Allow to cool before removing from the tin.
