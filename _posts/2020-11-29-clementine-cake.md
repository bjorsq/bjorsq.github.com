for the cake:

* 375g Clementines

* 225g caster sugar
* 250g ground almonds
* 1 tsp baking powder

for the ganache filling:

* 150g dark chocolate
* 250ml double cream
* 2 tbsp caster sugar

for the frosting:

* 60g softened butter
* 120g cream cheese
* 180g icing sugar

method

1. Put the clementines in a pan with cold water and bring to the boil. Simmer for 2 hours.
2. Drain and leave to cool, then remove the pips and blitz in a food processor (skins and all).
3. Preheat the oven to gas mark gas mark 5 / 375&deg;F / 180&deg;C
4. Beat the eggs, then add all the other ingredients.
5. Pour the mixture into a greased 20cm/8in springform tin (lined with greaseproof if you like).
6. Cover the tin in foil to prevent the top burning, and place in the centre of the oven. Bake for 1 hour, taking the foil off for the last 10 minutes.
7. Leave the cake to cool in the tin, and when cool, remove and slice in half.
8. Make the ganache by either melting the chocolate and beating in the cream and sugar, or by heating the cream and sugar then melting the chocolate in it.
9. Sandwich the two cake halves with the ganache.
10. Make the frosting by beating the butter with the cream cheese until smooth, then add the vanilla and gradually beat in the sugar. Slart it on the cake.
