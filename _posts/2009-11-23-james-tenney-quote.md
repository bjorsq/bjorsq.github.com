excerpt: a quote from one of my favourite composers

> [My music is] sound for the sake of perceptual insight - some kind of perceptual revelation. Somehow it seems to me that's what we're all doing - searching to understand our own perceptual processes. In a way, science is about the same thing, but its enterprise seems to be to understand the nature of reality through thought and intellection. It seems to me art is about understanding reality to the same extent, and as singularly, but through a different modality - through perception. I'm fascinated by science - physics, mathematics. I'm not very good at any of those things, but I'm really fascinated by them... I think we're all phenomenologists. The basic idea in phenomenology is making a more strenuous effort to see things as they are, depending upon whatever one is focusing on. I think the best scientists and the best artists are precisely that - phenomenologists."
