ingredients
-----------

* 150g _masoor dhal_ (split red lentils)
* 150g _moong dhal_ (yellow split mung beans)
* 100ml sunflower oil (plus a teaspoon for the lentils)
* 1 teaspoon cumin seeds
* 1 teaspoon brown mustard seeds
* &frac14; teaspoon asafoetida
* 3 medium tomatoes, blended
* 1 teaspoon turmeric
* 1 &frac12; teaspoons salt
* 3 teaspoons ground corander
* &frac12; teaspoon ground cumin
* &frac12; teaspoon _garam masala_
1 handful of fresh corander, finely chopped

### Masala
* 3-5 fresh green chillies
* 3-5 cloves garlic
* pinch of salt

method
------

1. Mix the _dhals_ together and rinse thoroughly in warm water (at least 4 times), drain.
2. Crush the chillies and garlic in a mortar and pestle with the pinch of salt to make a masala paste.
3. Put the _dhals_ in a pan with 700ml of boiling water, bring to the boil and simmer for a couple of minutes until is starts to foam. Skim any froth from the surface, then add a teaspoon of oil and simmer for 25 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the _dhals_ are soft. Remove from the heat but do not drain.
4. Heat the oil in a separate pan for 30 seconds, then add the cumin and mustard seeds. When the mustard seeds begin to pop, stir in the asafoetida, reduce the heat and add the tomatoes (watch out for spitting!)
5. Stir in the masala paste, turmeric, ground coriander and ground cumin, cook for a minute, then add the _dhals_.
6. Add more boiling water (100ml) and simmer for a few minutes, then add the _garam masala_.
7. Remove from the heat and sprinkle with the fresh corander, then leave to rest for at least 10 minutes to allow the flavours to infuse.
8. Reheat and serve.
