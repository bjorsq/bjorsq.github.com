ingredients
-----------

* 150g _masoor dhal_ (split red lentils)
* 150g _moong dhal_ (yellow split mung beans)
* 100ml sunflower oil (plus a teaspoon for the lentils)
* 1 teaspoon cumin seeds
* 1 teaspoon brown mustard seeds
* &frac14; teaspoon asafoetida
* 400g tin chopped tomatoes
* 1 teaspoon turmeric
* 1 &frac12; teaspoons salt
* 3 teaspoons ground corander
* &frac12; teaspoon ground cumin
* &frac12; teaspoon _garam masala_
* 1 handful of fresh corander
* 3-5 fresh green chillies, chopped
* 3-5 cloves garlic, chopped

method
------

1. Mix the _dhals_ together and rinse thoroughly in warm water (at least 4 times), drain.
2. Put the _dhals_ in a pan with 700ml of boiling water, bring to the boil and simmer for a couple of minutes until is starts to foam. Skim any froth from the surface, then add a teaspoon of oil and simmer for 25 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the _dhals_ are soft. Remove from the heat but **do not drain**.
3. Take the tomatoes, turmeric, ground coriander, ground cumin, salt, fresh coriander, chillies and garlic and blend.
4. Heat the oil in a pan for 30 seconds, then add the cumin and mustard seeds. When the mustard seeds begin to pop, stir in the asafoetida, fry for 20 seconds, then reduce the heat and add the sauce (watch out for spitting!) - fry for a couple of minutes.
5. Add the cooked _dhals_ and a little more boiling water (100ml), simmer for a few minutes, then add the _garam masala_.
6. Remove from the heat and leave to rest for at least 10 minutes to allow the flavours to infuse.
7. Reheat and serve.
