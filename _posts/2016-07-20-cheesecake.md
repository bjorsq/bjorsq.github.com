## ingredients

* 250g digestive biscuit
* 100g butter
* 1 vanilla pod
* 600g soft cheese
* 100g icing sugar
* 120ml double cream

## method

1. Melt the butter in a saucepan over low heat.
2. Break the digestive biscuits up into crumbs by placing in a plastic bag and whacking with a rolling pin.
3. Add the biscuit crumbs to the butter and mix thoroughly.
4. Lightly grease a 9in loose base cake tin (one where the base is separate to the sides), and press the biscuit mixture into the bottom. Compress the mix as much as possible, then put in the fridge to cool.
5. Add the soft cheese, icing sugar and cream to a mixing bowl and scrape the seeds from the vanilla pod into the mixture.
6. Beat the mixture for a few minutes until it is quite stiff, then spoon into the cake tine on top of the biscuits.
7. Leave in the fridge to cool for an hour or so, then take it out of the tin - I do this by putting the tin on a jar (which is just smaller than the tin), and pressing down on the sides of the tin.
