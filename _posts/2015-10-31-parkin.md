## ingredients

* 200g butter (plus some for greasing)
* 140g golden syrup
* 140g treacle
* 90g light soft brown sugar
* 1 large egg
* 4 tbsp milk
* 100g medium oatmeal
* 250g self-raising flour
* 1 tbsp ground ginger

## method

1. Preheat oven to 160&deg;C / 325&deg;F / gas mark 3.
2. Melt the syrup, treacle, sugar and butter together in a pan on low heat until the sugar has dissolved.
3. Mix together the oatmeal, flour and ginger and stir in the syrup mixture when it has cooled a little.
4. Whisk the egg and milk, and add to the mixture slowly, beating it all the time.
5. Grease a 9in tin with butter, pour in the mixture and place in the oven for 50 - 60 minutes.
6. Let it cool in the tray, then cut into pieces and store in an airtight container. The longer you leave it, the better it will get (3 days after cooking it will be perfect)
