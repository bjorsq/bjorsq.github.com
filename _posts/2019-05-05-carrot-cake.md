## ingredients

### For the cake

* 155ml sunflower oil
* 230g self-raising flour
* 1 tsp baking powder
* 1&frac12; tsp ground cinnamon
* &frac12; tsp mixed spice
* &frac12; tsp ground ginger
* 230g light brown muscovado sugar
* Finely grated zest of 1 satsuma or mandarin, plus strips to decorate
* 100g pecans, chopped
* 260g carrots, grated
* 3 eggs, beaten

### For the icing

* 75g butter, softened
* 300g full-fat cream cheese
* 150g icing sugar

## method

1. Preheat the oven to 180&deg;C (160&deg;C fan assisted), 360&deg;F/320&deg;F, Gas Mark 4.
2. Grease an 18cm loose-bottomed round cake tin and line with baking paper.
3. Sift the flour, baking powder and spices into a large bowl.
4. Add the sugar, zest, pecans and grated carrots, then stir until well combined.
5. Stir in the beaten eggs and oil, then mix well.
6. Pour into the prepared cake tin and bake in the oven for 1 hour or until a skewer comes out clean.
7. Transfer to a cooling rack, leave in the tin for 5 minutes, then turn out and leave to cool completely before icing.
8. For the icing, beat the butter in a large bowl with a hand mixer until really soft. Add the cream cheese and beat again until well mixed. Sift over the icing sugar, then beat until smooth. This should be enough to cover the cake with a 2-3mm layer of icing, or you can slice the cake and put some in the middle, and cover the top with a thin layer.
