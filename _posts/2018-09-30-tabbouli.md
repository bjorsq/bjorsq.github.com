ingredients
-----------

* 1 cup cracked wheat (bulghur) 
* small bunch of mint leaves
* large bunch of flat leaf parsley leaves
* 6 spring onions, fineley sliced
* good slug of olive oil
* juice of 2 lemons
* 2 ripe tomatoes
* 5 inches of cucumber
* salt and pepper

method
------

1. Cook the bulghur. I use coarse bulghur for this recipe which takes about 25 miuntes soaking in cold water, or 5-10 minutes in boiling water. If you prefer fine bulghur, this should only take 10-15 minutes in cold water - don't use boiling water as it may turn to mush.
2. Finely chop the mint, parsley and spring onion and add to the cooked bulghur and mix thoroughly. Mint to parsley ratio should be about 1:6
3. Chop the tomatoes and cucumber into similar sizes pieces - about 1cm cubes - and add to the mixture with the oil and lemon juice and toss.
4. Add salt and pepper to taste. You could also add a little garlic if you want
