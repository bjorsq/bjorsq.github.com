* 1 cup sugar
* 2 cups self-raising flour
* 1 egg in a cup, topped up with milk

2. Mix all ingrdients in a large bowl
3. Pour mixture into a greased loaf tin
4. Bake for 60 minutes

You can add mixed spice or cinnamon to this to add a bit of flavour, or even add some butter to make it more cakey. Best buttered hot out of the oven - keeps for a couple of weeks (if you don't eat it!).
