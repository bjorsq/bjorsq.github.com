starter
-------

Feed the starter with 75g strong white flour and 75g cold water every day if possible. If you miss a day or two, don't worry, just pour off the liquid 'hooch' and the crusty top part before you add the flour and water. If you're leaving it for more than 3 days, pop it in the fridge after a feed to put it to sleep.

making the dough
----------------

In the morning, after a feed, pour most of the starter (100g - 300g leaving a centimetre or so in the jar) into a mixing bowl. The starter is roughly 50:50 flour and water and I try to do a roughly 75% loaf, so I usually make it up like this:

* 300g starter, 350g flour, 220g water
* 200g starter, 400g flour, 270g water
* 100g starter, 450g flour, 320g water

DON'T FORGET THE SALT! You need 8 - 10g salt for this size loaf

I sometime use a mixture of flours with some wholemeal, spelt or rye flour - adding 50g - 100g rye flour is my usual loaf.

Mix it all up in the bowl - it will be quite sticky and wet, but you just need to make sure it is mixed thoroughly (you don't need to work it). Use a paddle to get it all off your hand.

proving
-------

Leave it covered in cling film until mid-afternoon - it should have risen a little by then. Over the next few hours, fold it over in the bowl using a paddle a few times.

At about 6pm, prepare the proving basket by lining it with the cotton liner, and sprinkling a generous amount of brown rice flour in the liner. Try to coat the inside of the liner with a thin layer of flour. Pour the dough into the liner, using the paddle to coax it all out of the bowl. Sprinkle a little brown rice flour around the edges to stop it sticking to the liner when it rises.

baking
------

Sometimes I bake it in the morning, and sometimes at night. If you want to bake in the morning, put the basket in the fridge overnight, otherwise leave it out to rise a bit.

Heat the oven to 225 degrees with the two halves of the loaf nest in it for 45 minutes - leave the silicone lining out. When it's nice and hot, take out the bottom (smooth) half, put in the silicone liner, and tip the loaf in from the basket. Score the top of the loaf, then take the lid out of the oven and put it on top. Try to line it all up nicely and trap the silicone liner between the two halves - they will both be very hot so you will need oven gloves.

Bake for 45 minutes - for an extra crusty loaf take the top part of the loaf nest off for the last 10 minutes. Tip out onto a wire rack and cover in a clean tea towel until it is cool enough to cut.
