5. Take a 25cm square or large oval casserole pot and layer up with a third of the tomato sauce, followed by half the aubergine, followed by a third of the mozzarella, then repeat. Top with the last of the tomato sauce and mozzarella.
6. Bake in the oven for 25 - 30 minutes, just until the mozzarella on the top layer is turning brown.
