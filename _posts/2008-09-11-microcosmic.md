excerpt: the cyclic nature of the universe
---

The scientists at CERN are getting excited about their new &pound;10bn machine - hoping to find evidence of dark matter to explain the origins of the universe. I reckon that the universe follows a cyclical path:

 * The BIG BANG
 * Universe expands
 * Creatures evolve on many different planets
 * A creature on one of the planets invents a Large Hadron Collider and perpetrates the big crunch
 * The BIG BANG
 * etc...

So they aren't really pushing the boundaries of science, they are merely fulfilling the destiny of the universe - to be reborn so another species can evolve enough in the distant future to mess the whole thing up and start again.
