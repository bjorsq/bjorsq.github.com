## instructions

### chocolate sponge

1. grease and line three 23cm baking tins with baking paper
2. pre-heat the oven to 180&deg;C / 350&deg;F / gas mark 4
3. sift the cocoa powder into a small bowl and add the boiling water a little at a time, and then the vanilla extract, gently stirring until you have a smooth paste
4. in a large bowl, cream the butter with the sugar until pale and fluffy.
5. beat the eggs, then gradually add to the butter mixture, beating thoroughly between each addition
6. fold in the ground almonds
7. mix together the flour and baking powder, then fold through the mixture with the milk, alternating about a third of each at a time
8. split the mixture between the prepared cake tins evenly
9. bake for approximately 30 minutes until the tops spring back and a skewer inserted comes out clean
10. remove from the oven and leave to cool in the tins for 5-10 minutes before turning out onto a wire rack to cool completely

### cherry sauce

1. in a medium saucepan, mix the liquid with the cornflour (corn starch), adding it a little at a time to form a smooth paste.
2. add the sugar and cherries and very gradually bring to the boil over a low to medium heat, stirring continually.
3. As the cherries soften, squash them with the back of the spoon to release the juice.
4. Continue to stir, simmering until the liquid becomes clear and slightly thickened.
5. Remove from the heat and cool slightly, before blending the cherries and sauce into a thick, smooth puree using either a hand-held or standard blender.
6. allow to cool completely, then add 1 to 2 tablespoons Kirsch cherry liqueur. The sauce should be a thick compote (with a thin jam-like texture) which will be used on top of the cake.

### mascarpone cream

1. in a large bowl, gently beat the cream cheese with a wooden/silicone spoon to loosen very slightly.
2. add the cream, icing sugar and vanilla and beat on a low to medium speed with a whisk until the Mascarpone cream has thickened to soft peaks. Be very careful not to over-whisk.

### assembling and decorating

1. Using a sieve over a jug/bowl, thoroughly drain the Cherries in Kirsch or syrup from the jar/can, reserving the liqueur/syrup. Set the cherries aside.
2. Although it probably won't be necessary, level the sponge cakes with a large sharp knife as required, so that they are flat top and bottom.
3. Turn two of the cakes over so that their underside is at the top (these will make up the two base layers of the gateau) and place one of them onto a serving plate or cake stand (if necessary securing with a small dab of the whipped cream).
4. Brush the upper surface of both these cakes with a little Kirsch liqueur or syrup and leave for 15 minutes or so to soak in. (If you prefer to do this stage while the cakes are slightly warm, that's fine, but it made little difference to the end result). You can alternatively use warmed cherry jam to brush over the cakes.
5. Next, either pipe or spread a thick layer of the whipped Mascarpone Cream over the first layer cake and randomly but gently push a handful of the drained cherries (from the Kirsch or syrup) into the cream, away from the outer edges.
6. Carefully place the second (Kirsch-brushed) sponge on top of the bottom layer and repeat the process of topping with cream and cherries, before placing the final sponge on the top.
7. Place in the fridge to cool for about 15 minutes.
8. Using a cake-scraper, smooth a thin layer of the Mascarpone cream over the entire cake (sides and top).
9. Take the crushed/grated chocolate and with small handfuls, gently brush the chocolate upwards from the bottom of the cake around the sides, so that it sticks to the cream. and the sides are evenly covered. This process may be easier if wearing a food-safe glove.
10. Tidy up the base by using a clean pastry brush to gently remove any 'dropped' chocolate from the serving plate around the cake.
11. Using a piping bag and a large star tip (or tip of choice), pipe rosettes of whipped Mascarpone cream around the edge of the top surface of the cake. Make sure that the rosettes join together so they form a barrier (this will retain the thick cherry sauce when added).
12. Carefully spoon a layer of thick cherry sauce onto the top of the cake, gently spreading it to the cream border (being careful not to damage the rosettes).
13. Take the drained Kirsch-soaked black cherries (or other remaining cherries) and arrange on top of the cake, gently pushing into the layer of cherry sauce.
14. Dust/sprinkle the cherry surface and cream rosettes with a little cocoa powder and a sprinkle of edible glitter (if using).
15. Best served immediately or on the same day. Store left-overs in the fridge for up to 3 days.
