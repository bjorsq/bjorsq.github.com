ingredients
-----------

 * 4oz/110g pudding rice (short grain) or risotto/paella rice.
 * 1oz/25g butter
 * 2oz/50g sugar
 * 1 litre/1.7 pt/35 floz semi-skimmed milk
 * vanilla essence or pod, and grated nutmeg

method
------

1. Place all ingredients in an ovenproof dish and give them a stir.
2. Put in the oven at 140&deg;C, 275&deg;F, Gas Mark 1.
2. Stir after 30 minutes - it should be ready in 1.5 - 2 hours

This is a basic recipe, which can be embellished by the use of cream or full fat milk to make it richer, or the addition of lemon zest / cardammon to give a different flavour. The original recipe I took this from adds a bit of brandy and sultanas for an old english type flavour.
