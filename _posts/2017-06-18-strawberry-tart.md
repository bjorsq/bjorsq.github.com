method
------

1. Whizz the flour, butter, sugar and salt in a food processor until it looks like damp crumbs
2. Press the pastry into into a 9" non-stick tart tin - use a cup to flatten it out a bit - and prick the base with a fork.
3. Put the tin into the freezer for 15 minutes, and turn the oven on to 180&deg;C / 350&deg;F / gas mark 4.
4. Bake the pastry base in the oven for 20-25 minutes until lightly golden.
5. Allow to cool in the tin, then transfer on to a plate.
6. Whip the cream adding the icing sugar and flavour (vanilla or lemon zest) just before it gets thick.
7. Fold in the yoghurt, then fill the pastry base with the cream mixture.
8. Hull the strawberries and cut into halves, then tastefully arrange them on top.
