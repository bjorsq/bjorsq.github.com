ingredients
-----------

* 6 medium potatoes
* olive oil
* 1 heaped tsp chopped fresh rosemary
* 2 cloves garlic
* salt and pepper

method
------

1. Preheat the oven to 180&deg;C / 350&deg;F  / gas 4).
2. Peel and slice the potatoes as thin as you can, by hand or using a mandolin or food processor.
3. Chop the garlic up finely, or use a garlic press.
4. Layer the potatoes in the dish, putting a little salt and pepper and a sprinkling of the garlic, rosemary and olive oil on each layer.
5. Arrange the top layer of potatoes so it will look stylish and italian, then drizzle some water over the top - up to half the depth of potatoes (no more). The water serves to cook the potatoes, but should all have evaporated as steam by the time you take the dish out of the oven. Finish off with some more salt and a drizzle of olive oil.
6. Bake in the oven for 45 - 60 minutes, until the top layer is browned.
7. Take out of the oven and rest for 10 minutes covered with foil - this is especially important as you want the olive oil to be re-absorbed into the potatoes for maximum tastiness.
