excerpt: Possibly the most pointless waste of money in the world

I watched this awful programme on the telly the other week and I can't seem to get it out of my head. It was a car programme (I usually switch over straight away), and they did a feature on personalised number plates. Apparently, you can get them direct from the DVLA at a fraction of the cost that you pay from a car dealer. The whole thing is a scam really, but the bit that stuck in my head was about getting number plates to mask the age of your car.

The idea is that you buy a plate like FOG 4080 or something which doesn't mean anything to anybody, but looks different (and therefore cool?). Then, people can't guess the age of your car, but I thought about it a little - this would only really be any use if you were selling it and you wanted to make out that the car was actually newer than it was. But if you're selling it, surely the buyer will want to look at the log book or something to find out how old it is, especially if you're selling it with a personalised number plate. So then, what use is that?

I had to think a while, and the only other answer I could come up with was you wanted to mask the age of your car so if you kept it really shiny, people would think it was new, and the number plate wouldn't give the game away. Great! But who the fuck goes around looking at the shininess and upkeep of cars and comparing this to the registration to see if they are in good nick or not? What kind of mad person looks at other people's cars and number plates and thinks about it? Who gives a shit about how old other people think their car is enough to pay &pound;600 for a number plate?
