* 50g cocoa powder
* 1 teaspoon baking powder
* &frac12; teaspoon salt
* 150g granulated sugar

For the Chocolate Ganache

Instructions
------------

1. To make the spiced red wine poached pears, bring all the ingredients (except for the pears) to a boil in a large saucepan and let simmer while you peel the pears, leaving the stem intact. Slice the bottom of the pears to create a flat surface so the pears can easily stand.
2. Gently place the pears in the simmering poaching liquid and poach for 30 min, turning every 5 min or so, to ensure even color. 
3. Gently remove the pears from the poaching liquid, strain the liquid and set aside.
4. Preheat the oven to gas mark 4 / 350&deg;F / 180&deg;C
5. Grease a 9-inch round cake tin with butter.
6. Whisk together sugar, egg, vanilla, melted butter and 240ml of the spiced red wine in a large bowl.
7. Mix together flour, cocoa powder, baking powder and salt in a medium bowl then whisk into the butter mixture.
8. Pour the batter into the tin and place the pears bottom side down in the batter.
9. Bake for 45-50 minutes until a toothpick inserted in center comes out clean.
10. To make the ganache, warm the cream and wine in a small saucepan on the stove until simmering, then pour over the chocolate, let it sit for a minute, then stir to combine. Brush ganache on the top of the cake, letting it drip down the sides. Sprinkle with flaky sea salt, and let stand until ganache is set (about 30 minutes). Any leftover ganache can be served along side the cake.
