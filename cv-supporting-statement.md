I have excellent interpersonal skills and regularly liaise with colleagues in IT and with members of the Academic community. I am able to develop positive working relationships through effective communication and the maintenance of a positive outlook to my work. I always maintain a professional approach in all aspects of communication, and I have excellent interpersonal skills which I use every day with the many users of the services I provide and with colleagues throughout the University. I can present complex technical information in a way which makes it easy to understand, and regularly provide training and advice to colleagues in the use of the systems I develop. I have written user and developer guidance for the software I have developed, and I regularly communicate with external suppliers to ensure that expected standards are maintained in the work they carry out.

I have a practical approach to problem solving and have been engaged in numerous projects in my own company and at the University which have required these skills. I regularly need to analyse the needs of research projects in order to provide effective solutions to problems. An example is a recent research project where I was asked to contribute to the detail of a research funding bid. The process had reached an impasse, where a colleague in the data service, and externally appointed user experience designer and the PI could not agree a way forward. I was able to suggest a possible solution using my exoerience of repository systems, data management and website development which achieved a separation of concerns between using the data for research and presentation. This utlilised skills and knowledge from a project I was involved with in the library service (RoaDMaP) which involved assessing different solutions to provide a technical solution to Research Data Management. I maintian a healthy working relationship with colleagues in the Research Data Management Service (based in the library).

I have programming skills in PHP, Python, Perl, JavaScript, HTML/CSS and XML. I also have extensive knowledge of Windows, Mac and Linux operating systems and software, web server and database configuration and administration, code editors and IDEs and multimedia editing software. I continually strive to increase my knowledge and skills through researching and evaluating emerging technologies, including both hardware and software. I am committed to gain further professional qualifications through self-study, education and training. I am committed to the development of effective working practices, and regularly present my work in this area to colleagues as an example of best practice. This includes recent presentations on the use of workflows in source code management using git, the use of pipelines in Azure DevOps for Continuous Integration, and the use of Node.js to automate development processes.

I currently work in the Application Support team at the University of Leeds and manage a number of data repositories built using EPrints. The work is varied and interesting and allows me freedom to develop my skills in Perl. The data repositories are a key componenet in the Research Data Service and the Library's Special Collections, and are integrated with many other systems.

Previous to this I ran a WordPress website development service, used to create small websites for Research Projects, Research Centres and conferences. I maintained the University's WordPress theme and associated plugins, and developed new plugins and themes for the service. The WordPress website development service is based on the work I carried out between 2010 and 2016 while working for two of the nine faculties at the University. This work was entirely self-motivated and based on a careful analysis of the needs of these two faculties, and I co-wrote the bid to turn it into a University-wide service in 2016. It currently hosts in excess of 500 websites.

I have a sound knowledge of the Software Development Lifecycle, and have an ITIL foundation qualification.
